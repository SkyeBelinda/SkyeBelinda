I would describe the command line as tool for developers which lets you give clear specific commands to the computer to action.
ten terminaml commands include 1: cd [directory] change directory which changes or takes you to your directory of choice. 2:pwd gives a list of all the directories. 3: cd.. lets you move up ine directory. 4: clear will clear the screen you're typing on. 5: will reset your command line, 6: cp is short for copy, I like to think of it as copy and paste, and when you use it correctly you can copy files to other directories. 6: cd will take you to your home directory. 7:Tab will autofill 8: mkdir will allow you to make a new directory, i think of it as "make directory" 9:rm -R(dir) will let you remove a directory including all of its contents.
