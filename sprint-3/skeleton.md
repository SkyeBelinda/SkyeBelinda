 What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px.
When the screen is resized to 550 pxl the layout of the page changes by only having the most important information visible at the top, and text and images are re-sized,
  How do you think that works? That works by giving @media queiries or by giving min:width 550 pxl conditions - with instructions to change the text size and image size to a percentage of the page.
