What is you site's primary purpose?
My site would have two main purposes - firstly a learning tool for myself to practice web dev techniques - secondly it would be promoting myself as a personal brand through demonstrating my work and skills.

Who is your target audience?
My target audience would be fellow Dev students, and also potential employers as a way of looking at my work and seeing what I'm capable of.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like visitors to interact with the site by reading the content and clicking on links they find interesting to find out more. The type of experience I'd like my visitors to have is one that is functionally easy, visually appealing, and naturally flows.

I'd like it to be easy to use, and firstly visually appealing, and then if someone wants to look further it has valuable text/ content.

I'd like users to read my blog posts, about me, projects, and get an idea or vibe of who I am, and be able to easily contact me or comment and add to content further if they'd like to.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

To build my site with the desired user experience I'll start out with the wireframe. This will have in it the F shape, with the most important info top left, working its way across, then down and across.

I might use the skeleton CSS framework to help with styling.

I'll be sure to include @media queries, and will start with mobile first design, so thinking about what the most important info for someone when accessing my site through a mobile, and then working upwards (or bigger) to a more detailed desktop sized page.

Because my site is changing and ever growing my Index page will not have a link to each of my blogs, it will have just one link to the blog home page which will then showcase all of my blogs. My Index page will include a link to 'about me', a link to my projects, and how to contact details, I'll also link my github page.
